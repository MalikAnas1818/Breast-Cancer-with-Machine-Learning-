# Breast Cancer Prediction Model

## Project Overview

The Breast Cancer Prediction Model is a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign based on various diagnostic features. This project leverages data science and machine learning techniques to build a predictive model and deploy it as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## Background

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and improving survival rates. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset contains features computed from digitized images of breast cancer biopsies. This dataset is used to train a machine learning model to predict the malignancy of tumors based on these features.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Use `pandas` to clean, preprocess, and handle missing values.
- **Data Visualization:** Use `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizing data distributions and relationships between features.
- **Model Building:** Use `scikit-learn` for training and evaluating machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines.
- **Web Application:** Deploy the model using `streamlit` to create an interactive interface for users to input data and receive predictions.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `streamlit`
- `joblib` (for saving/loading models)

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn streamlit joblib
