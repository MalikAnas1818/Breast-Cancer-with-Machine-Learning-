# Breast Cancer Prediction Model

## Overview

This project involves building a Breast Cancer Prediction model using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features extracted from breast cancer data. The project uses `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`, and `streamlit` for data processing, visualization, model building, and deployment.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Use `pandas` to clean and preprocess the dataset.
- **Data Visualization:** Use `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize the data and understand the distribution of features.
- **Model Building:** Use `sklearn` for feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
- **Web Application:** Deploy the model using `streamlit` to create an interactive web app for predictions.

## Requirements

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `streamlit`
- `joblib` (for saving/loading models)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn streamlit joblib

### Notes:
- Replace placeholders like `your_model.pkl` and `your_script_name.py` with actual file names used in your project.
- Customize the dataset URL or description if you use a different dataset or if additional details are relevant.
- Include installation instructions and usage examples to make it easier for others to understand and use your project.
